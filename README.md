# PyScriptProofofConcept

## Usage
This is a very simple proof of concept for PyScript, since it is still in early Alpha and several of their sample projects are currently bugged I figured I'd do something exceedingly simple for the time being. It takes random numbers imports multiple libraries and  uses Bokeh to make an interactive graph. 

##Installation
Copy and paste the entire file into your own blank html then drag and drop onto your web browser. Load times for the graph are a little slow ideally that will improve as it advances through Alpha.

##Future Plans
as support for react and pyscript expands I have a few projects not related to this. If time permits I may add input areas for the values so you can use random or you chosen values.
