# PyScriptProofofConcept

## Usage
This is a very simple proof of concept for PyScript, since it is still in early Alpha and several of their sample projects are currently bugged I figured I'd do something exceedingly simple for the time being. It takes a selection of movies from Rotten Tomatos and IMBD giving a graph of ratings, and count of records by Genre

## Installation
Copy and paste the entire file into your own blank html then drag and drop onto your web browser.

## Future Plans
as support for react and pyscript expands I have a few projects not related to this. If time permits I may add input area to search parrticular titles

## Inspiration
Both Samuel Chan and Traversy Media Youtube channels offered inspiration and places I could double check my code.
